## Problem Statement and Solution

### The Problem: Challenges in Raw Feeding for Dogs

Raw feeding, a diet consisting of uncooked meats, bones, fruits, and vegetables for dogs, has gained popularity in recent years. According to a survey by the University of Guelph, approximately 66% of dog owners have considered raw feeding, with 13% actively practising it [1]. However, this dietary approach comes with significant challenges:

1. **Nutritional Imbalance**: A study published in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that 95% of homemade pet diets (including raw diets) were deficient in at least one essential nutrient [2]. This highlights the difficulty in creating balanced raw meals without expert knowledge.

2. **Food Safety Concerns**: The FDA reports that raw pet foods are more likely to be contaminated with bacteria like Salmonella and Listeria compared to processed pet foods [3]. This poses risks not only to pets but also to their human families.

3. **Time and Effort**: Preparing raw meals requires significant time and effort. A survey by PetfoodIndustry.com found that 42% of pet owners who stopped raw feeding cited the time-consuming nature of meal preparation as a primary reason [4].

4. **Cost Management**: Raw feeding can be expensive. The American Kennel Club estimates that raw diets can cost up to $5 per day for a 30-pound dog, compared to $1 per day for premium commercial kibble [5].

5. **Lack of Standardisation**: Unlike commercial pet foods, there's no standardised way to ensure raw diets meet all nutritional requirements, leading to potential health issues in pets.

<br>

### How the Raw Feeding API Solves These Problems

The Raw Feeding API addresses these challenges through a comprehensive, data-driven approach:

1. **Nutritional Balance**:
   - The app includes a database of ingredients with detailed nutritional information (see lines 39-48 in the `cli_controller.py` file).
   - It allows users to create recipes and automatically calculates nutritional totals, ensuring balanced meals (as seen in the `Recipe` model, lines 24-35 in `recipe.py`).

2. **Food Safety Guidance**:
   - While the API can't eliminate all food safety risks, it can provide guidelines and best practices for safe raw food handling and storage.
   - Future updates could include features to track ingredient freshness and suggest safe storage times.

3. **Time and Effort Reduction**:
   - The API streamlines meal planning by allowing users to create, store, and reuse recipes (evident in the `create_recipe` function, lines 20-91 in `recipe_routes.py`).
   - It can generate shopping lists based on selected recipes, saving time on meal preparation.

4. **Cost Management**:
   - By allowing users to input ingredient costs, the API can help calculate the cost per meal and per day for each dog.
   - Users can compare different recipes and ingredients to find cost-effective options while maintaining nutritional balance.

5. **Standardisation and Personalisation**:
   - The API provides a standardised framework for creating raw diets, ensuring consistency across meals.
   - It allows for personalisation based on individual dog profiles (weight, age, breed), as seen in the `Dog` model implementation.

6. **Expert Knowledge Access**:
   - The ingredient database and recipe creation tools encapsulate expert knowledge about canine nutrition, making it accessible to all users.
   - Future versions could incorporate AI-driven recommendations based on the latest veterinary research.

7. **Community and Sharing**:
   - The API supports public and private recipes (line 8 in `recipe.py`), allowing users to share successful meal plans and learn from each other.

By addressing these key challenges, the Raw Feeding API empowers dog owners to confidently and safely implement raw diets for their pets. It combines the benefits of raw feeding with the convenience and assurance of nutritional completeness typically associated with commercial pet foods.

## Database System: Benefits and Drawbacks

The Raw Feeding API utilises PostgreSQL as its underlying database system. This choice brings several benefits and drawbacks to the application:

### Benefits:

1. **ACID Compliance**: PostgreSQL is fully ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliant, ensuring data integrity and reliability. This is crucial for the Raw Feeding API, where maintaining accurate relationships between users, dogs, recipes, and ingredients is essential.

2. **Complex Queries**: PostgreSQL excels at handling complex queries, which is beneficial for the Raw Feeding API when dealing with relationships between multiple entities (e.g., searching for recipes based on ingredients or calculating nutritional totals).

3. **Scalability**: As the Raw Feeding API grows and accumulates more users, dogs, and recipes, PostgreSQL can handle large amounts of data efficiently, supporting the application's scalability.

4. **JSON Support**: PostgreSQL's native JSON support is advantageous for storing and querying semi-structured data, which could be useful for future expansions of the API, such as storing custom attributes for recipes or ingredients.

5. **Concurrent Users**: PostgreSQL's excellent handling of concurrent users ensures that the Raw Feeding API can serve multiple users simultaneously without compromising data integrity or performance.

6. **Full-Text Search**: PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities can be leveraged to implement efficient search functionality for recipes and ingredients in the Raw Feeding API.

7. **Data Integrity**: PostgreSQL's foreign key constraints and cascading updates/deletes help maintain referential integrity between related entities in the Raw Feeding API, such as ensuring that when a recipe is deleted, its associated recipe ingredients are also removed.

### Drawbacks:

1. **Resource Intensity**: PostgreSQL can be more resource-intensive compared to simpler database systems, which might impact the Raw Feeding API's performance on lower-end hosting environments.

2. **Complexity**: The advanced features of PostgreSQL come with increased complexity, which may require more specialised knowledge for optimisation and maintenance of the Raw Feeding API's database.

3. **Vertical Scaling Limitations**: While PostgreSQL can scale vertically (by adding more resources to a single server), it has limitations in horizontal scaling compared to some NoSQL databases. This could potentially impact the Raw Feeding API's ability to distribute data across multiple servers if extreme scalability becomes necessary in the future.

4. **Setup and Configuration**: Initial setup and configuration of PostgreSQL can be more complex compared to some other database systems, potentially increasing the development time for the Raw Feeding API.

5. **Memory Usage**: PostgreSQL's default configuration can sometimes lead to high memory usage, which might require careful tuning for optimal performance of the Raw Feeding API, especially if deployed on memory-constrained environments.

Despite these drawbacks, the benefits of PostgreSQL, particularly its robustness, reliability, and ability to handle complex relationships, make it a suitable choice for the Raw Feeding API. The application's reliance on structured data and complex relationships between entities (users, dogs, recipes, ingredients) aligns well with PostgreSQL's strengths.

## Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) System

The Raw Feeding API utilises SQLAlchemy as its Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, integrated with Flask through the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension. This ORM plays a crucial role in the application's architecture and functionality.

### Features and Purpose:

1. **Abstraction of Database Operations**: SQLAlchemy abstracts the complexities of SQL queries and database operations, allowing the Raw Feeding API to interact with the database using Python objects and methods. This abstraction simplifies database interactions and reduces the risk of SQL injection vulnerabilities.

2. **Database Agnostic**: While the Raw Feeding API currently uses PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy's database-agnostic nature allows for potential future migrations to other database systems with minimal code changes.

3. **ORM and Core**: SQLAlchemy provides both high-level ORM functionality and lower-level Core functionality, giving the Raw Feeding API flexibility in how it interacts with the database.

4. **Session Management**: SQLAlchemy's session management handles the complexities of database transactions, ensuring data consistency and integrity in the Raw Feeding API.

5. **Relationship Mapping**: The ORM allows for easy definition and management of relationships between entities (e.g., User-Dog, Recipe-Ingredient), which is crucial for the Raw Feeding API's data model.

6. **Query Construction**: SQLAlchemy provides a powerful query construction API, enabling complex queries to be built programmatically in Python, which is utilised in various parts of the Raw Feeding API, such as recipe searches and filtering.

### Functionalities in the Raw Feeding API:

1. **Model Definition**: SQLAlchemy is used to define the data models for the Raw Feeding API, such as User, Dog, Recipe, and Ingredient. These models are defined in separate files and include column definitions, relationships, and model-specific methods. For example, the Recipe model:


```py
class Recipe(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(128), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text)
    instructions = db.Column(db.Text)
    is_public = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
    user_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)

    # Relationships
    # Relationship: One-to-Many with RecipeIngredient model
    # This relationship allows easy access to all ingredients in this recipe
    # The 'cascade' parameter ensures that when a recipe is deleted, its ingredients are also deleted
    ingredients = db.relationship('RecipeIngredient', back_populates='recipe', cascade="all, delete-orphan")

    # Relationship: Many-to-Many with Dog model
    # This relationship allows easy access to all dogs associated with this recipe
    # The 'secondary' parameter specifies the association table for the many-to-many relationship
```


2. **Relationship Handling**: The ORM manages complex relationships in the Raw Feeding API, such as the many-to-many relationship between Dog and Recipe through the `dog_recipe` association table.

3. **Query Execution**: SQLAlchemy is used throughout the application to execute database queries. For example, in the recipe routes, it's used to fetch, create, update, and delete recipes.

4. **Data Validation**: While not directly a feature of SQLAlchemy, the ORM integrates well with Flask-Marshmallow for data serialization and validation in the Raw Feeding API.

5. **Lazy Loading**: SQLAlchemy's lazy loading feature is utilised in the Raw Feeding API to efficiently load related objects only when they are accessed, improving performance.

6. **Cascading Operations**: The ORM's cascading functionality is used in the Raw Feeding API to automatically handle related records. For instance, when a recipe is deleted, its associated recipe ingredients are also removed due to the cascade setting:


```py
    # Relationship: One-to-Many with RecipeIngredient model
    # This relationship allows easy access to all ingredients in this recipe
    # The 'cascade' parameter ensures that when a recipe is deleted, its ingredients are also deleted
    ingredients = db.relationship('RecipeIngredient', back_populates='recipe', cascade="all, delete-orphan")
```


7. **Custom Properties**: SQLAlchemy allows the definition of custom properties on models, which is used in the Recipe model to calculate total calories:


```py
    @property
    def total_calories(self):
        """
        Calculate the total calories for the recipe.
        
        This property sums the calories of each ingredient, multiplied by its quantity.
        It iterates through all RecipeIngredient objects associated with this recipe.
        
        Returns:
            float: The total calories of the recipe.
        """
        return sum(ri.ingredient.calories * ri.quantity for ri in self.ingredients)
```


8. **Query Optimisation**: The ORM's capabilities are leveraged to optimise database queries in the Raw Feeding API. For example, eager loading can be used to fetch related recipes in a single query:

```python
dogs = Dog.query.options(joinedload(Dog.recipes)).filter_by(user_id=current_user_id).all()
```

9. **Event Listeners**: SQLAlchemy's event system can be used to automatically update fields or perform actions before or after certain database operations. For example, updating a dog's age before insert or update:

```python
def calculate_age(target, *args, **kwargs):
    today = datetime.now().date()
    target.age = relativedelta(today, target.date_of_birth).years

db.event.listen(Dog, 'before_insert', calculate_age)
db.event.listen(Dog, 'before_update', calculate_age)
```

10. **Hybrid Properties**: SQLAlchemy's hybrid properties allow for properties that can work both on the Python object level and at the SQL expression level. This can be useful for complex queries:

```python
class Recipe(db.Model):
    # ... other fields ...
    
    @hybrid_property
    def is_high_protein(self):
        return self.total_protein > 30

    @is_high_protein.expression
    def is_high_protein(cls):
        return cls.total_protein > 30

# Can be used in queries
high_protein_recipes = Recipe.query.filter(Recipe.is_high_protein).all()
```

By utilising SQLAlchemy as its ORM, the Raw Feeding API benefits from a powerful, flexible way of interacting with its database, enabling efficient data management and complex query operations while maintaining clean and maintainable code.

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) and Database Design

The Raw Feeding API's database design is represented by a Crow's Foot Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). This diagram illustrates the relationships between different entities in our system, providing a clear visual representation of how data is structured and interconnected.

![Raw Feeding API Entity Relationship Diagram](./docs/RawFeeding_ERD.png "Raw Feeding API ERD")

### Relationships and Normalisation

1. **Users and Dogs (One-to-Many)**:
   - A user can have multiple dogs, but each dog belongs to only one user.
   - This relationship is in Third Normal Form (3NF), as the dog's attributes depend only on the dog's primary key (id) and the user_id serves as a foreign key.

2. **Dogs and Recipes (Many-to-Many)**:
   - A dog can have multiple recipes, and a recipe can be associated with multiple dogs.
   - This relationship is implemented using a junction table (DogRecipes), which is in 3NF.
   - The junction table contains only the primary keys of Dogs and Recipes, avoiding transitive dependencies.

3. **Users and Recipes (One-to-Many)**:
   - A user can create multiple recipes, but each recipe is created by only one user.
   - This relationship is in 3NF, with the user_id in the Recipes table serving as a foreign key.

4. **Recipes and Ingredients (Many-to-Many)**:
   - A recipe can have multiple ingredients, and an ingredient can be used in multiple recipes.
   - This relationship is implemented using a junction table (RecipeIngredients), which is in 3NF.
   - The junction table includes quantity and unit information, which directly depend on the combination of recipe_id and ingredient_id.

### Normalisation Comparison

Let's compare the current RecipeIngredients junction table to a less normalised version:

Current (3NF):
```
RecipeIngredients (id, recipe_id, ingredient_id, quantity, unit)
```

Less Normalised (1NF):
```
Recipes (id, user_id, recipe_name, recipe_method, is_public, ingredient1_id, ingredient1_quantity, ingredient1_unit, ingredient2_id, ingredient2_quantity, ingredient2_unit, ...)
```

The 3NF version offers several advantages:
1. Eliminates data redundancy by storing ingredient information separately.
2. Allows for an unlimited number of ingredients per recipe.
3. Simplifies updates and maintenance of ingredient information.
4. Reduces the risk of data anomalies during insertions, updates, or deletions.

### How These Relations Aid Database Design

1. **Flexibility**: The many-to-many relationships between Dogs and Recipes, and between Recipes and Ingredients, allow for maximum flexibility in creating and assigning recipes.

2. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key relationships ensure referential integrity, preventing orphaned records and maintaining data consistency.

3. **Efficient Queries**: The normalised structure allows for efficient querying. For example, to find all recipes for a specific dog:

```sql
SELECT r.* FROM Recipes r
JOIN DogRecipes dr ON r.id = dr.recipe_id
WHERE dr.dog_id = ?
```

4. **Scalability**: The design can easily accommodate new features, such as adding nutritional information to ingredients or additional attributes to recipes, without major structural changes.

5. **Reduced Redundancy**: By normalising to 3NF, we've minimised data duplication, which saves storage space and reduces the risk of data inconsistencies.

6. **Easy Maintenance**: The separation of concerns (e.g., keeping ingredient details separate from recipes) makes it easier to update and maintain the database.

This ERD and its normalised relationships provide a solid foundation for the Raw Feeding API, ensuring data integrity, flexibility, and efficiency in database operations. The design supports the core functionalities of the application while allowing for future expansions and enhancements.

<br>
<br>

## Models and Relationships

The Raw Feeding API utilises several interconnected models to represent the core entities of the application. These models and their relationships are crucial for the efficient operation and data management of the system.

<br>

### User Model

The User model represents registered users of the application. It stores essential information such as username, email, and password hash.


```py
class User(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'user'
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(64), index=True, unique=True)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), index=True, unique=True)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(128))
    is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)

```

#### Relationships:
- One-to-Many with Dog model
- One-to-Many with Recipe model

These relationships allow for efficient querying of a user's dogs and recipes. For example:

```python
user = User.query.get(user_id)
user_dogs = user.dogs  # Retrieves all dogs belonging to the user
user_recipes = user.recipes  # Retrieves all recipes created by the user
```

<br>

### Dog Model

The Dog model represents individual dogs in the system, storing information such as name, breed, date of birth, and weight.


```py
class Dog(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    breed = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    date_of_birth = db.Column(db.Date, nullable=False)
    weight = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
    profile_image = db.Column(db.String(255))
```


#### Relationships:
- Many-to-One with User model
- Many-to-Many with Recipe model (through DogRecipe association)

The Dog model includes a method to calculate the dog's age:


```py
    def calculate_age(self):
        """
        Calculate and set the dog's age based on its date of birth.
        
        This method computes the difference between the current date and the dog's
        date of birth, setting the 'age' attribute to the number of years.
        """
        today = datetime.now().date()
        self.age = relativedelta(today, self.date_of_birth).years
```


This relationship structure allows for queries such as:

```python
dog = Dog.query.get(dog_id)
owner = dog.user  # Retrieves the dog's owner
dog_recipes = dog.recipes  # Retrieves all recipes associated with the dog
```

<br>

### Recipe Model

The Recipe model represents individual raw feeding recipes, including details like name, description, and instructions.


```py
class Recipe(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(128), nullable=False)
    description = db.Column(db.Text)
    instructions = db.Column(db.Text)
    is_public = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)
    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow, onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
```


#### Relationships:
- Many-to-One with User model
- Many-to-Many with Dog model (through DogRecipe association)
- One-to-Many with RecipeIngredient model

The Recipe model includes a property to calculate total calories:


```py
    @property
    def total_calories(self):
        """
        Calculate the total calories for the recipe.
        
        This property sums the calories of each ingredient, multiplied by its quantity.
        It iterates through all RecipeIngredient objects associated with this recipe.
        
        Returns:
            float: The total calories of the recipe.
        """
        return sum(ri.ingredient.calories * ri.quantity for ri in self.ingredients)
```


These relationships enable queries like:

```python
recipe = Recipe.query.get(recipe_id)
creator = recipe.user  # Retrieves the recipe creator
associated_dogs = recipe.dogs  # Retrieves all dogs associated with this recipe
recipe_ingredients = recipe.ingredients  # Retrieves all ingredients in this recipe
```

<br>

### Ingredient Model

The Ingredient model represents individual ingredients that can be used in recipes, including nutritional information.


```py
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = db.Column(db.String(128), nullable=False, unique=True)
    category = db.Column(db.String(64))
    calories = db.Column(db.Float)
    protein = db.Column(db.Float)
    fat = db.Column(db.Float)
    carbohydrates = db.Column(db.Float)
    fiber = db.Column(db.Float)
```


#### Relationships:
- One-to-Many with RecipeIngredient model

This allows for queries such as:

```python
ingredient = Ingredient.query.get(ingredient_id)
recipes_using_ingredient = [ri.recipe for ri in ingredient.recipe_ingredients]
```

<br>

### RecipeIngredient Model

The RecipeIngredient model serves as a junction table between Recipe and Ingredient, allowing for many-to-many relationships with additional attributes like quantity and unit.


```py
class RecipeIngredient(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    recipe_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('recipe.id'), nullable=False)
    ingredient_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('ingredient.id'), nullable=False)
    quantity = db.Column(db.Float, nullable=False)
    unit = db.Column(db.String(20), nullable=False)
```


#### Relationships:
- Many-to-One with Recipe model
- Many-to-One with Ingredient model

This model enables queries like:

```python
recipe_ingredient = RecipeIngredient.query.filter_by(recipe_id=recipe_id, ingredient_id=ingredient_id).first()
recipe = recipe_ingredient.recipe
ingredient = recipe_ingredient.ingredient
quantity = recipe_ingredient.quantity
unit = recipe_ingredient.unit
```

<br>

### DogRecipe Association

The DogRecipe association table facilitates the many-to-many relationship between Dog and Recipe models.


```py
dog_recipe = db.Table('dog_recipe',
    # Foreign key referencing the Dog model's id
    db.Column('dog_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('dog.id'), primary_key=True),
    # Foreign key referencing the Recipe model's id
    db.Column('recipe_id', db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('recipe.id'), primary_key=True)
)
```


This association allows for queries such as:

```python
dog = Dog.query.get(dog_id)
dog_recipes = dog.recipes

recipe = Recipe.query.get(recipe_id)
dogs_using_recipe = recipe.dogs
```

<br>

### How Relationships Aid Database Implementation

1. **Efficient Data Retrieval**: The relationships allow for easy and efficient retrieval of related data. For example, getting all recipes for a specific dog or all ingredients in a recipe can be done with simple queries.

2. **Data Integrity**: Foreign key relationships ensure referential integrity, preventing orphaned records and maintaining data consistency.

3. **Flexible Queries**: The ORM relationships enable complex queries making it easier to implement features like filtering recipes by ingredients or finding all dogs on a specific diet.

4. **Cascading Operations**: Relationships can be set up with cascading deletes, ensuring that when a parent record is deleted, all related child records are also removed, maintaining database consistency.

5. **Lazy Loading**: SQLAlchemy's lazy loading feature allows for efficient database queries, only fetching related data when it's actually accessed.

These model relationships form the backbone of the Raw Feeding API, enabling complex operations like recipe creation, nutritional analysis, and personalized feeding plans for dogs. The structure allows for scalability and easy addition of new features as the application grows.
